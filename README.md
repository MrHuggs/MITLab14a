# MITLab14a

My daughter suggested we do an assignment from her signal processing class at MIT together.

Associated lecture: https://sigproc.mit.edu/_static/fall18/lectures/lec14a.pdf

Actual lab: https://sigproc.mit.edu/fall18/labs/14a

To run, you need the input file signal.pkl. I haven't checked it in becaues it is quite large (800,000,161 byte).

song8.wav is one of the extracted songs.
